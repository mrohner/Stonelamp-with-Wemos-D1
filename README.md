# Stonelamp-with-Wemos-D1

This is a small project for a mood lamp in a glass vase with 4 x 15 5050 Neopixels. The Neopixel strips are mounted on a 1cm x 1cm x 20cm hollow aluminium profile inside the vase and connected accordingly. I drilled a hole into the vaseâ€™s bottom for the three cables 5V, GND, and DI leading to the Wemos D1 mini which is buried in the wooden socket of the lamp. Blynk is used to control the different patterns, speed and brightness as well as on/off the light. There are 12 patterns you may chose from. Program updates can be sent through the wireless network using OTA.

The lamp is controlled by MQTT. Can be switched on/off with Alexa. Uses Blynk to control via i-phone (through a Blynk client), I can also switch the lamp with a 433MHz wall mount switch. pls. see https://github.com/mrohner/433MHz-MQTT-Bridge-with-Wemos-D1 .
